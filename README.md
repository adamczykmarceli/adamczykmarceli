# Hi 👋, I’m Marceli. #

I am a Data Analyst 📊 from Kraków, Poland. I am currently working at Allegro, supporting the analytical growth of Fairmarkit. My work mainly compromises of:
- Supporting the business with the product and users' knowledge 📚
- Identifying key areas for growth 🌱
- Constructing hypotheses and testing them 💭
- Defining metrics and quantitive measures ⏱️
- Cooperating with engineers in order to create trackable events ⚒️
- Composing SQL queries (PostgreSQL, Oracle, BigQuery) 🔍
- Process automatization (Composer, Airflow, Jupyter Notebooks) 🚗
- Data visualisation (Tableau, Google Data Studio) 🖥️

I am currently focusing more on exploring using Python as the tool for analysis and machine learning models.
